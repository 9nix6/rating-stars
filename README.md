Rating Stars
============

This project replicates the UX of Amazon.com's 5-star rating system. When you hover over a star, the preceding stars highlight blue, and clicking makes the highlighted stars turn yellow and stick.

No external images are required, and only plain Javascript is used. (The stars themselves are inline SVG data URIs in the CSS, making them load instantly.)

Everything you need is in `index.html`. There are no external files.
